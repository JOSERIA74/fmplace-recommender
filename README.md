# FM Place Recommender API

This is a Python-based recommendation API for FM Place, deployed on Google Cloud Run. It receives a user's form responses and returns the top 3 FP&A tools based on a matrix scoring model and similarity calculation.

â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile                         # Container definition for Cloud Run
â”œâ”€â”€ matriz_ponderada.csv               # Final scoring matrix (tools x questions)
â””â”€â”€ Matriz Score y Vector Ponderacion.xlsx # Source: raw scores + weights + metadata

## ðŸ§  What It Does

This API:

1. Loads a precomputed matrix of scores (`matriz_ponderada.csv`)
2. Loads metadata and weighting factors from the Excel file
3. Accepts a JSON with user responses to 13 questions
4. Builds a binary vector (one-hot) for the 60 options
5. Applies weightings to generate a user embedding
6. Calculates cosine similarity between the user vector and each tool
7. Returns the top 3 tools with similarity scores
